Intelligent Customer Help Desk with Smart Document Understanding This is repositroy build with the help of Watson Asistance,Discovery,Clould Function and Node Red app of IBM Cloud. It is made with the regard of partial fullfillment of Smartinternz Internship Program.


Product Descrpition
The typical customer care chatbot can answer simple questions, such as store locations and hours, directions, and maybe even making appointments. When a question falls outside of the scope of the pre-determined question set, the option is typically to tell the customer the question isnâ€™t valid or offer to speak to a real person.  


In this project, another thing is that bot searches the result in the preloaded device's owner manual and shows the solution if the query is regarding the product's information otherwise, it replies with the predefined replies to the answers. Also if the user wants to talk to representatives then chatbot simply passes the call to the representative which is quite a good thing if the user is not able to get a satisfactory solution.This can all be done by using the Smart Document Understanding of the Watson Discovery to train it on what text in the owners manual is important and what is not. And then integrate it with Watson Assistant using cloud functions and finally use that Watson Assistant skills in the Node-RED to present the perfect UI for the users so that they can easily use it.

In Watson Discovery I have used the ecobee3_userguide.
